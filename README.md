# Prediction-of-Survival-on-Titanic

This is hands-on project done on predicting the survival of passengers who travelled on Titanic. The dataset has been acquired from Kaggle. The competition on Kaggle has been titled as "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster".

The data has been split into two groups - a training set (train.csv) and a test set (test.csv).

The solution has been coded in Python (titanic.py).

The final model has an accuracy of 77.51 %.
